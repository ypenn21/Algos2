    // two system design questions on top of the algo questions listed
    // Did this one: Design a system that is fail safe with no single point of failure for a number that increments by one
    // Didn't figure out good solution for this: Design a system that takes input phone type and run time design a system that schedules different tasks on the phone
    // scale it and think of features to monetize it.
    // design idea for snap chat: https://drive.google.com/file/d/15971Ar8bz5BqWb_n881JdOWDWbgwlwMl/view?usp=sharing
